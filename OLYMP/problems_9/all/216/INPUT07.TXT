CHESS





Script as per performances in the Prince Edward Theatre in June 1986.



*indicates spoken line or speech



NB: Chess commentaries by William Hartston are not included in this script, neither are 
counterpoint/backing lyrics in some scenes, e.g. the Prologue. 







c 1986 by Tim Rice

PROLOGUE: THE STORY OF CHESS 



(NB: The Chorus portray at various times characters in the lyric of the Prologue.)



ARBITER

Each game of chess means there's one less

Variation left to be played

Each day got through means one or two

Less mistakes remain to be made



chorus

Each game of chess means there's one less

Variation left to be played

Each day got through means one or two

Less mistakes remain to be made



Not much is known

Of early days of chess beyond a fairly vague report

That fifteen hundred years ago two princes fought

Though brothers, for a Hindu throne



Their mother cried

For no-one really likes their offspring

fighting to the death

She begged them stop the slaughter

with her every breath

But sure enough one brother died



Sad beyond belief

She told her winning son

You have caused such grief

I can't forgive this evil thing you've done



He tried to explain 

How things had really been

But he tried in vain 

No words of his could mollify the queen



And so he asked the wisest men he knew

The way to lessen her distress

They told him he'd be pretty certain to impress

By using model soldiers on

A chequered board to show it was his brother's fault

They thus invented chess



Chess displayed no inertia

Soon spread to Persia, then west

Next the Arabs refined it,

Thus redesigned, it progressed

Still further yet

And when Constantinople fell in 1453

One would have noticed every other refugee

Included in his bags a set



Once in the hands 

And in the minds of leading figures of the Renaissance

The spirit and the speed of chess made swift advance

Through all of Europe's vital lands



Where we must record 

The game was further changed

Right across the board

The western touch upon the pieces ranged



King and queen and rook

And bishop, knight and pawn

All took on the look

We know today, the modern game was born



With such success 

We see a game that started by mistake in Hindustan

And boosted in the main by what is now Iran

Reach every corner of the globe with nation

Squaring up to nation to determine, no holds barred,

Who owns, who made, who will parade

The champion of chess



*arbiter

The international chess federation of which I have the honor of being president 
announces that the next world championship will take place in Merano, Italy.



The current world champion, Anatoly Sergievsky of the Soviet Union, will defend his 
title against Frederick Trumper of the United States of America.



The first player to achieve six victories will be declared champion. The first game will 
begin on March 27th.







ACT ONE



Scene One : The Main Square of Merano, Italy.



Is this The Sound of Music? Tirolean hats, leather pants, yodels and dancing. Snow-
capped mountain peaks and icy rivers. Narrow, crowded, colourful streets of shops. 
Grapes and the benefits of the spa. The MAYOR and CITIZENS are waiting for an 
important arrival at the station.



ciTIzens of merano (including MAYOR)

O light the heart

That lingers in Merano

Merano! The spa no

Connoisseur of spas would miss

So healthy

Highly recommended

Is this sweet metropolis 

Mental and physical bliss!



The gods have smiled

And bless-ed is Merano

Merano! There are no

Fitter burghers to be found

Such vigour!

Take the time to taste us

We'll give you a welcome that's typically Tirol

For then we are sure of our ground

Right now we're Italian - we used to be German

The border keeps shifting around



MAYOR (solo)

Speaking as one of the patriarchs

I don't mind taking your lira or marks



CITIZENS

Oh I get high when I saunter by

the mountains of Merano

Rosy-cheeked Merano

Flourishing to a fault

The sparkling streams, the bracing air

The therapeutic salt

I'd have to be carried away to call a halt!



Oh I feel great in this bouncing state

O hail to thee Merano

Hearty hale Merano

Any objections? Nein!

Where breathing in will turn you on 

Where water tastes like wine

Get out your get up and go and get in line

It's living your life in a show by

Rodgers and Hammerstein!



O sad the soul

Who passes by Merano

Merano! So far no

Soul has ever passed us by 

They love us

Why not stay forever?

Oh so many reason why

All those in favour say "Aye"

Aye!



So sing our song

Let's hear it for Merano

Merano! Soprano

Alto, tenor, bass agree 

We're wholesome

What a happy haven

This is a place where your arteries soften

Cholesterol hasn't a chance

From mountain to valley the natural goodness

Is fighting pollution's advance



MAYOR (solo)

So come to us and feel the force

All major credit cards taken of course



citizens

Oh I get high when I saunter by

the mountains of Merano

Rosy-cheeked Merano

Flourishing to a fault

The sparkling streams, the bracing air

The therapeutic salt

I'd have to be carried away to call a halt!



Once in a while all the gods will smile

on little old Merano

Humble shy Merano

Suddenly hits the press

And I report with all the pride

And joy that I possess

Half of the world and his wife

Has our address

Our little town will be rife

With games of chess!





(A whistling/orchestral interlude during which a train rushes through the station)



Get out your get up and go and get in line

It's living your life in a show by

Rodgers and Hammerstein!



Another train. This one stops. The man more responsible than any other for the 
enormous interest in a World Chess Championship match, the current world champion, 
the American FREDERICK TRUMPER, gets off the train and pushes his way through 
the melee. He brushes aside the official reception. He is flanked by his second/lover 
FLORENCE VASSY and two or three other members of his delegation (males) one of 
whom is also the man who is ostensibly head of the American TV production company 
covering the event, WALTER DE COURCEY.



FREDERICK surveys the town, its people and its visitors with patronising amusement.



FREDERICK

What a scene! What a joy!

What a lovely sight

When my game is the big sensation!

Has the mob's sporting taste

Altered overnight?

Have they found new sophistication?



Not yet! They just want to see

If the nice guy beats the bum

If it's East-West

And the money's sky-high

They all come

*Florence!

(He takes a photograph of FLORENCE)



You can raise all you want

If you raise the roof

Scream and shout and the gate increases 

Break the rules -- break the bank

I'm the living proof

They don't care how I move my pieces



I know I'm the best there is

But all they want is a show

Well that's all right I'll be glad to oblige

S.R.O. S.R.O.



FREDERICK and his entourage leave. Determined to have their welcoming ceremony, 
the MAYOR & CITIZENS give the full works to a bewildered stranger who happened to 
be on the same train.



Oh I get high when I saunter by

the mountains of Merano

Rosy-cheeked Merano

Flourishing to a fault

The sparkling streams, the bracing air

The therapeutic salt

I'd have to be carried away to call a halt!



Oh I feel great in this bouncing state 

O hail to thee Merano 

Hearty hale Merano

Any objections? Nein!

Where breathing in will turn you on

Where water tastes like wine

Get up you get up and go and get in line

It's living your life in a show by

Rodgers and Hammerstein!



Now for the sell

We put the ice into paradise

We are the salt of the earth

Sound as a bell

Check out the waters

And check out the hygiene

At which we excel

Check into an hotel

And schnell

Body and soul get well!









Scene Two : Frederick's Suite/Press Conference



The Palace Hotel, Merano. FREDERICK's (and FLORENCE's) suite. FREDERICK is 
alone, playing chess against a computer.



*COMPUTER

Knight D 5.

*FREDERICK

Bishop A 5 - check



(FLORENCE enters with a bundle of newspapers)



florence

Well, we can't complain that you're being ignored

by the press



*FREDERICK

What'd they say? What'd they say?



florence

They're not too polite



FREDERICK

They say I'm a shit?



florence

(Well), yes

*They pulled you to pieces in 

five different languages



(FREDERICK goes up to FLORENCE, kisses her quickly, and starts looking through 
some papers)



*Here we are - The Times -

You "thrive on unpleasantness"



(FREDERICK finds this amusing, and FLORENCE seems to too)



*Le Monde: "FREDERICK Trumper La Honte des echecs."



FREDERICK

I don't believe that they can't see my game

I'm like that tennis player, what's his name? 

They love to hate me and for us that's dollars!



florence

*Die Welt: Trumper die gross lecker skandal die schatz!

(Trumper - the greatest scandal of chess!)



FREDERICK

Hey, look here's a piece that some idiot's written on you

*"Florence Vassy, petite Hungarian-born Englishwoman

His gentle companion" - huh! If they only knew



florence (pushing him onto the bed)

What do you mean? I've always been gentle with you Freddie -



BOTH (reading)

"She stands by her champion"



FREDERICK

*I like this - "whose

Demands are so infantile - "

*I don't like this!



(he throws the paper away)



florence

If you don't like it then it's up to you 

They like the Russian - they could like you too



FREDERICK

*Commie newspapers!

Of course the bastards all support the Russian



florence

But Sergievsky seems a sweet opponent -

So why do you abuse him all the time?

*Freddie, I love you very much but just for once, don't go on about the *Russians at the 
press conference, okay?



FREDERICK

*All Soviets deserve abuse!



(Dissolve into one of the hotel's conference rooms. A gaggle of REPORTERS, 
PHOTOGRAPHERS, INTERVIEWERS and TV PERSONNEL assembled to speak to 
FREDERICK, facing the gathering. FLORENCE not yet there.



reporter #1

Does your opponent deserve such abuse?



FREDERICK

*All Soviets deserve abuse!



reporter #2

But even you must concede he can play



FREDERICK

*Yeah, he's the best Red on the circuit, sure, I'll give him that -



reporter #3

He hasn't lost for a long time

He could be a tough nut to crack



FREDERICK

*Listen, if he gets one game off of me it's because I want to keep the *press interest going 
-



reporters

Why do you persist 

With vicious attacks,

Ungracious remarks re:

Opponents? It smacks

Of a lack of conviction, admit

You're under duress

And that your only skill left

Is for money not chess



If Soviet life's

As grim as you claim

Then how come their boys are

So good at the game?

Though you swear the American dream

Is clearly the best

You're no advertisement for

Life and times in the West.



(FLORENCE enters)



reporter #4

Why did you risk the whole match breaking down?



FREDERICK

*I don't know what you're saying. What are you - what are you implying?



reporter #1

All your outrageous demands, your conceit -



FREDERICK

*I don't see anything outrageous in demanding what I'm worth.



reporter #5

They pay you all that you ask for 

And then you demand even more -



FREDERICK

*I'm the reason you're all here -who's ever heard of Sergievsky?



reporters

It's hard to believe what we're reporting

Why so disparaging? Not very sporting



FREDERICK

*Are the Communists sporting? My God -



reporters

Tell all this to the United Nations

Are you an asset to East-West relations?



FREDERICK

*What is this? What have the Russians ever done for East-West *relations? Do you guys 
have any serious questions?



reporter #6

What's your impression of our little town?



FREDERICK

*Rather cold and dull. As I expected.



reporter #2

Where would you rather have played? Leningrad?



FREDERICK

*Leningrad was an insulting Soviet suggestion -



reporter #3

They only tried to be friendly 

They would have played in New York



FREDERICK

*Aw - c'mon, you know as well as I do what their motives were.



reporters

You protest too much, we see your ploy, a

Big noise to hide your fears, pure paranoia



FREDERICK

*I'm not paranoid. They're out to get me!



reporters

Tell all this to the United Nations

Are you an asset to East-West relations?



FREDERICK

*Jesus...



reporter #7

Will you be quitting for good if you lose?



(FREDERICK stares at the questioner, but makes no reply)



reporter #2

How come your second's a girl, lover boy?



FREDERICK

(a double take, then:)



*What'd you say?



reporter #2

How come your second's a girl, lover boy?



FREDERICK rushes at the reporter and hits him. He storms off. Pandemonium, from 
which emerges:



reporters

Well, what did I say?

He's out of his tree

He's finally flipped

And between you and me

He's no hope of retaining his crown

In his frame of mind

In fact he shouldn't have come here

He should have resigned 



FLORENCE is desperately trying to restore order. As the REPORTERS continue, she 
dominates their words with a powerful outburst:



florence

Smile, you got your first exclusive story

Now you can bask in his reflected glory

Naked, unprovoked, Yankee aggression!

Oh what a credit to your great profession!



reporters

Much better to quit

While still number one

Than crash to defeat

Reputation undone

Though he's proved to himself

It's a communist plot

If you ask me it's money that did it

And started the rot



It's sad that the best

His country's produced

Is crumbling in front

Of our eyes and reduced

To a mindless abuse and assault

On all of mankind

In fact he shouldn't have come here

He should have resigned....



The scene changes after FLORENCE's speech, during the REPORTERS' final words.









Scene Three : Anatoly and Molokov/Where I Want to Be



MOLOKOV's suite in Merano. ANATOLY SERGIEVSKY, the Russian challenger to 
FREDERICK, and the head of his delegation, ALEXANDER MOLOKOV, have been 
watching the Press Conference on TV. The image of FLORENCE's face during her final 
speech to the REPORTERS is now on the screen. Newspapers, with all the stories about 
FREDERICK are lying around.



*molokov

The man is utterly mad - believe me, Anatoly, you're playing a lunatic.



*anatoly

That's the problem. He's a brilliant lunatic and you can't tell which way he'll jump - like 
his game he's impossible to analyse - you can't dissect him, predict him - which of course 
means he's not a lunatic at all.



molokov

What we've just seen's a pathetic display

From a man who's beginning to crack

He's afraid - he knows he isn't the player he was

And he won't get it back



anatoly

Nonsense!

Why do my seconds

Always want to believe

Third-rate propaganda -



molokov

My friend, please relax

We're all on your side

You know how you need us -



anatoly

I don't need my army of so-called 'advisors'

And 'helpers' to tell me

The man who's revitalised chess single-handed

Is more or less out of his brain

When it's very clear he's sane



molokov

Listen, we don't underestimate Trumper -

We won't get caught in that trap

After all, winning or losing reflects on us all -



anatoly

Oh don't give me that crap!

I win - no one else does

And I take the rap if I lose



molokov

It's not quite that simple

The whole world's tuned in

We're on display

We're not merely sportsmen -



anatoly

Oh please don't start spouting that old party line

Yes I know it's your job but

Just get out and get me a chess-playing second

In thirty-six hours we begin

That is if you want to win!



*molokov

Wanting's not sufficient - we have to know , ee must make sure. All men have a weak-
ness, and his is that woman; take her and you win the game!



*anatoly

So you think I can't win otherwise?



*molokov

I'm not saying that - I'm just making certain - and she's attractive...then there's her 
intriguing family history - Hungary, 1956 and all that -



*anatoly

I'm a chess player, Mr. Molokov - you go and play these other games!



MOLOKOV leaves, displeased. ANATOLY switches off the TV. He wanders over to a 
chess board and moves some pieces.



Who needs a dream?

Who needs ambition?

Who'd be the fool

In my position?

Once I had dreams

Now they're obsessions

Hopes become needs

Lovers possessions



Then they move in

Oh so discreetly

Slowly at first

Smiling too sweetly

I opened doors

They walked right through them

Called me their friend

I hardly knew them



Now I'm where I want to be and who I want to be

and doing what I always said I would

and yet I feel I haven't won at all

Running for my life and never looking back

in case there's someone right behind

to shoot me down and say he always knew I'd fall



When the crazy wheel slows down

Where will I be? Back where I started



Don't get me wrong

I'm not complaining

Times have been good

Fast, entertaining

But what's the point?

If I'm concealing 

Not only love 

All common feeling 



Now I'm where I want to be and who I want to be

and doing what I always said I would

and yet I feel I haven't won at all

Running for my life and never looking back

in case there's someone right behind

to shoot me down and say he always knew I'd fall



When the crazy wheel slows down

Where will I be? Back where I started.



A RUSSIAN enters

*russian

Molokov tells me you want to play chess. I have one hour before delegate's conference.



*anatoly

Go to hell!









Scene Four: The Arbiter's Chambers



The ARBITER has summoned the two opposing delegations to his room immediately 
prior to the first game of the match. The soviet delegation consists of about a dozen 
people led by MOLOKOV. The American delegation consists of FLORENCE (not yet 
present), WALTER and two other genuine seconds.



delegates (the division of lines between Soviet and U.S.sides is not indicated here)

No one can deny that these are difficult times

No one can deny that these are difficult times



*MOLOKOV

Mr. de Courcey!

*walter

Mr. Molokov -



DELEGATES

It's the US versus USSR

Yet we more or less are -



No one can deny that these are difficult times

-to our credit putting all that aside

We have swallowed our pride



These are very dangerous and difficult times



It really doesn't matter who comes out on top

Who gets the chop -

No one's way of life is threatened by a flop -



But we're gonna smash their bastard

Make him wanna change his name

Take him to the cleaners and devastate him

Wipe him out, humiliate him

We don't want the whole world saying

They can't even win a game

We have never reckoned 

On coming second

There's no use in losing



It's the red flag up against stars and stripes

But we're peace-loving types



No one can deny that these are difficult times...



It's a sweet hail-fellow-well-met affair

For both eagle and bear



These are very dangerous and difficult times



For those that say that this is not a friendly clash

Don't be so rash!

I assure you comrades that is balderdash



What a load of whingeing peasants!

Thinking they can win - they can't!

What an exhibition of self-delusion

This one's a foregone conclusion

But enough of all this beating

Round the bushes of detente

We intend to collar

The Yankee dollar

We shall trash them

Thrash them



delegates (continued)

The value of events like this need not be stressed

When East and West

Can meet as brothers, ease the tension over drinks 

Through sporting links

As long as your man sinks



(Enter ARBITER)

arbiter

I've a duty as the referee

At the start of the match

On behalf of all our sponsors

I must welcome you

Which I do - there's a catch



I don't care if you're a champion

No-one messes with me

I am ruthless in upholding

What I know is right

Black or white - as you'll see



I'm on the case

Can't be fooled

Any objection

Is overruled

Yes I'm the Arbiter and I know best



chorus (of ARBITER acolytes)

He's impartial, don't push him, he's unimpressed



arbiter

You got your tricks

Good for you

But there's no gambit

I don't see through

Oh I'm the Arbiter, I know the score



ARBITER + chorus

From square one I'll/he'll be watching all 64



arbiter

If you're thinking of the kind of thing

That we've seen in the past

Chanting gurus, walkie-talkies, 

Walkouts, hypnotists,

Tempers, fists - not so fast



This is not the start of World War Three

No political ploys

I think both your constitutions are terrific so

Now you know, be good boys



I'm on the case

Can't be fooled

Any objection

Is overruled

Yes I'm the Arbiter and I know best



chorus

He's impartial, don't push him, he's unimpressed.

(FLORENCE enters to take up a central position amid the American delegation) 



*arbiter

If the leaders of both delegations are now present, we are available to consider their pre-
match applications, representations or objections. Miss Vassy?



*florence

Thank you. The American delegation wishes to protest the size of the Soviet delegation 
which far exceeds the permitted number -



*molokov

Our delegation consists of just four people, including our champion. Our doctor, PT 
expert, psychologist, security agents and chef cannot be considered delegates.



*arbiter

Objection overruled. Mr. Molokov?



*molokov

The Soviet delegation has reason to believe that the American player's chair could contain 
communications devices. It objects to the constitution of the chair -



*florence

That's impossible. Both chairs were made in Sweden. With non-aligned aluminum -



*arbiter

Objection overruled.



*walter

On behalf of the television companies, making such a major financial contribution to this 
match, I request the Arbiter's permission for an opportunity to be given to a few 
commercial supporters of chess to set up a discreet display of wares in the arena -



*molokov + soviet delegates

Objection!



*arbiter

Overruled! Mr. de Courcey, further economic discussion with my office could clear the 
way to a fresh look at the status of merchandizing and advertising interests. But now let 
us dedicate ourselves to the spirit of chess!



all

Don't you find it rather touching to behold

The game that came in from the cold

Seen for what it is - religion plus finesse

Countries, classes, creeds as one, in 

Love of chess



Suddenly the cathedral-like atmosphere is shattered by the entrance of a garish, colourful, 
cheer-leading mob of MERCHANDISERS:



MERCHANDISERS

Whether you are pro or anti

Or could not care less

We are here to tell you

We are here to sell you chess

Not a chance of you escaping from our wiles

We've locked the doors, we've blocked the aisles

We've a franchise worth exploiting

And we will - yes we will!

When it comes to merchandising

We could kill



When you get up -

When you get up in the morning

Till you crash at night

You will have to live your life

With bishop, rook and knight

Clean your teeth with chequered toothpaste

Wear our vests

Our kings and queens on bouncing breasts

You could even buy a set

And learn to play

We don't mind we'll sell you something

Anyway



We've done all our market research

And our findings show

That this game of chess could be around

A month or so

Maybe it's a bit confusing

For a game

But Rubik's Cubes were much the same

In the end the whole world bought one

All were gone

By which time we merchandisers

Had moved on



By which time we had moved on!



Scene Five : Chess



The actual arena. We dissolve from the ARBITER's chambers to the spectacular setting 
for the match. The two players say nothing during this scene. However, their manner at 
the board becomes more and more agitated during the scene. They both get up from the 
board and get into a near-fight which ends with FREDERICK pushing ANATOLY into 
the table, spilling board and pieces over the floor.



Present are FLORENCE, MOLOKOV, the ARBITER and his assistants. Throughout the 
scene we see and hear commentators and commentaries on the big match. 



*TV PRESENTER #1 (on screen)

The opening match of the World Chess Championships got underway today in the small 
Tyrolean town of Merano, Italy. The title, which will be contested between the current 
world champion Frederick Trumper and the Soviet challenger Anatoly Sergievsky, will 
go to the first man who wins six clear games. Experts are predicting that since many 
games may be drawn, the contest could last as long as two months. The political 
overtones of this contest between a Russian and an American has attracted more than 
usual interest for a match which is increasingly taking on the aspects of a confrontation 
between East and West. 



*tv PRESENTER #2 (on screen)

This attack is either brilliant or crazy, I don't know which. Frederick's giving up his 
bishop just to trap the Russian's king in the center. It's a fantastic idea. If it works. 
Trumper's won the white queen and I think that spells curtains for Mr. Sergievsky. This 
is Kurt Johnson reporting for CBN News in Merano, Italy.



*TV PRESENTER #3 (on screen)

And now for a further report, we go to our chess expert, Will Hodson [?], here in 
Merano.



*hodson (on screen)

The world championship match here in Merano has begun with a really dramatic victory 
for the American champion Frederick Trumper. This same position must be on every 
chess board in Merano because everybody's talking about this game. Trumper with the 
white pieces just attacked from the start. All the books say you must defend with black in 
the early stages but Trumper's always been someone to break the rules. He just attacked 
from the word go. Sergievsky's never landed a decent punch in the whole game. 
Trumper sacrificed a pawn, then a bishop, broke through [?] king in position and when 
Sergievsky resigned in this position in front of me, he was just hopelessly behind on 
material. That's a drastic defeat for the Russian and a brilliant victory for Trumper.



*tv PRESENTER #5 (on screen)

And now from the World Chess Championships in Merano, Italy, at the end of the first 
week's play, current World Champion Frederick Trumper has taken a commanding lead 
by two wins to nothing....



At the end, there is pandemonium:



*tv PRESENTER #6

There's been a sensational development here in the very first game of the world Chess 
Championships here in the snow-covered Tyrolean town of Merano, Italy. The board and 
the pieces have been thrown to the floor in disgust by one or other or both players, the 
champion has walked out in a rage....



arbiter

I'm on the case

Can't be fooled

Any objection 

Is overruled

Don't try to tempt me

You've no hope

I don't like women

I don't take dope

I'm the Arbiter, my word is law

From square one I'm watching you



(Lyrics below are as revised and used throughout the run)

(By all the pawns 

(On Heaven's board

(Of all officials, 

(Why me, oh Lord?

(The greatest insult 

(Suffered yet

(By my profession, 

(But do not forget

(I'm the Arbiter, my word is law

(From square one I'll be watching you





Scene Seven : Quartet (A Model of Decorum and Tranquility)



FLORENCE, MOLOKOV ANATOLY and the ARBITER remain in the arena. 



molokov

We wish, no must, make our disgust

For this abuse perfectly clear

We're here for chess - are the US?

If so why foul the atmosphere?



florence

I must protest - our delegation has a host 

of valid points to raise 

Our player's sporting attitude's beyond all praise

As any neutral would attest

But we concede

The fact his masters bend the rules is not a player's fault

We'll over look their crude political assault

And under protest will proceed



MOLOKOV (simultaneously with FLORENCE's

speech above)

We wish, no must, make our disgust

At this abuse perfectly clear

We're here for chess - are the US?

If so, why foul the atmosphere?





molokov (simultaneously) ARBITER

If your man's so sweet I call this tune

Then why his fighting talk? No-one's immune

If he's not a cheat To my power

Then why on earth Once in this hall

Did he go take a walk?

FLORENCE

Why let him loose? 

He'll soon reduce I am not surprised

This great event He wanted fresher air

To a brawl Once he realized

There was no hope

It's very sad Of your lot playing fair

To see the ancient and 

Distinguished game How sad to see

That used to be What used to be



MOLOKOV + FLORENCE

A model of decorum and tranquility

Become like any other sport

A battleground for rival ideologies

To slug it out with glee



ANATOLY (simultaneously) MOLOKOV

Through the elegant yelling We wish, no must

Of this compelling Make our disgust

Dispute At this abuse perfectly clear

Comes the ghastly suspicion We're here for chess - are the US?

My opposition's If so why foul the atmosphere?

A fruit



FLORENCE (simultaneously) ARBITER

I don't suppose I must insist

You understand the strain and That you desist

pressure getting where he's got If you value

For then you'd simply call him Your livelihood

highly-strung and not

Imply that he was one of those



ANATOLY MOLOKOV

But how can you It seems to us

Work for one who There's little point in waiting

Treats you like dirt? here all night for his return

Pay must be good And since a peaceful match is

our soul concern

FLORENCE We won't make an official fuss

I'm not getting rich

My only interest In short we rise

Is in something which Above your guy's

Gives me the chance Tantrums, dramas,

Of working with the best Dirty tricks



anatoly ARBITER

I can only say

I hope your dream comes true Get this straight, I

Till that far-off day Will not stand by

I hope you cope While you play at

With helping number two Politics



ANATOLY, FLORENCE, ARBITER & MOLOKOV (together)

A model of decorum and tranquility

Become like any other sport

A battleground for rival ideologies

To slug it out with glee



*arbiter

Enough of this piety! If the players do not return to the arena within 24 hours, the match 
is null and void - the game is greater than its players.



The ARBITER leaves, as does ANATOLY. FLORENCE and MOLOKOV remain to 
salvage the situation.



molokov

*The game is greater than its players, Miss Vassy - how true!



I don't know how you can allow this

Harm to be done to chess, and how this

Baby of yours can be persuaded 

Back to the game



florence

*Easy. You stop playing politics and you start playing chess.



I don't know how you have the gall to

Criticise us when it is all too

Obvious this is what you wanted -

We get the blame



*Your man, following orders, was up to some sort of bust-up from the *word go...



molokov

You really are mad! He has no orders!

Now let me put my cards upon your table

If he is aggrieved then who can blame him?

He is up against a man who's less than stable



florence

*Freddie less than stable? You're goading him -



Who rocked his chair throughout the match then?

Who sniffed and coughed, began to scratch then

Played with his flag and tapped his fingers?

Then took a walk! 

Your precious boy!



molokov

*A piccydillo -



florence

*Peccadillo.



molokov

*- peccadillo compared with the neurotic behavior of Trumper -



florence

Listen, you Plutocratic throwback

You and your cronies want to go back

Home to your dachas, not the saltmines?

We better talk



*molokov

I wish, Florenz (he mispronounces her name) -



*florence

Florence.



*molokov

- you would refrain from cheap political jibes at a time when cooperation between us is 
vital. Besides, I thought you would be reluctant to criticise fellow Eastern Europeans



florence

*Fellow Eastern Europeans! I was born a Hungarian. Remember Hungary? *I wish I 
could. I was only five when you bastards moved in. I have no *memory of my 
homeland, my people, my mother and father - all taken from *me by you-



And you call yourself a fellow Eastern European!



molokov

Come now, Miss Vassy, we're digressing

Back to the point, let's start addressing 

All our attention to the World Chess Championship -



*florence (after a long pause in which she wonders

whether to contemplate any further dealings with this 

man. She decides she has to. She takes out a 

piece of paper from her bag) 

The Merano Mountain Inn - famous for its peace and tranquility - that's where I want you 
to deliver me one Soviet Grandmaster...







Scene Eight : Nobody's Side



FLORENCE moves into a TV control room. FREDERICK is there with WALTER.



*walter

For God's sake - be reasonable -



*FREDERICK

Twenty thousand dollars!



walter

Why should we pay you to televise tantrums? 

We prefer to see chess being played



(he sees FLORENCE as he prepares to leave)



You can deal with him - he's getting heated -

Now he's claiming that he's underpaid (exits)



FREDERICK (into a microphone)

*I said, twenty thousand dollars - a game!



(He wheels round to face FLORENCE)



*And as for you -

I shouldn't have to be dealing with Walter

Where were you when the shit hit the fan?



FLORENCE

Saving your income by fixing a meeting

So you better start liking the man!



(she hands him a piece of paper)



FREDERICK (ignores the paper)

When the interest is bigger than ever

And my walk-out my smartest move yet

All you say is that I ought to meet him

On the top of a mountain?



FLORENCE

You bet!



FREDERICK

Can't you see that you're losing your grip, dear

Are the Communists fooling you too?

Why should I be the only one trying -



FLORENCE

You wanna lose your only friend?

Well, keep it up you're doing fine

Why this humiliation?

Why treat me like a fool?

I've taken shit for seven years

And I won't take it anymore



FREDERICK

I'm only teasing Soviets

With gentle bonhomie

And you've a better reason to be anti-them than me



florence

There's a time and there's a place



*FREDERICK

Well how about here and now? Are you for me or for them?



florence

There's a time and there's a place 



FREDERICK (into a mike - his voice is

duplicated and re-processed:)

1956 - Budapest is rising

1956 - Budapest is fighting

1956 - Budapest is falling



I'd have thought you'd support

Any attack on these people

On the people who ran

Mindlessly over your childhood

Don't let them fool you for 

Thirty years on they're the same



florence

1956 - Budapest is fighting

1956 - Budapest is falling

1956 - Budapest is dying



FREDERICK (simultaneously with FLORENCE's lines above)

They see chess as a war

Playing with pawns just like Poland

If you walk out on me

You're really betraying your father

Were he alive now

He'd surely be dying of shame



florence

You know that there's nothing I've done

That he'd be ashamed of in my whole life!

Why'd you have to do this to me?



(FREDERICK leaves)



florence

What's going on around me

Is barely making sense

I need some explanations fast

I see my present partner

In the imperfect tense

And I don't see how we can last

I feel I need a change of cast

Maybe I'm on nobody's side



And when he gives me reasons

To justify each move

They're getting harder to believe

I know this can't continue

I've still a lot to prove

There must be more I could achieve

But I don't have the nerve to leave



Everybody's playing the game

But nobody's rules are the same

Nobody's on nobody's side

Better learn to go it alone

Recognize you're out on your own

Nobody's on nobody's side



The one I should not think of

Keeps rolling through my mind

And I don't want to let that go

No lover's ever faithful

No contract truly signed

There's nothing certain left to know

And how the cracks begin to show!



Never make a promise or plan

Take a little love where you can

Nobody's on nobody's side

Never stay too long in your bed

Never lose your heart, use your head

Nobody's on nobody's side



Never take a stranger's advice

Never let a friend fool you twice

Nobody's on nobody's side

Never be the first to believe

Never be the last to deceive

Nobody's on nobody's side



Never leave a moment too soon

Never waste a hot afternoon

Nobody's on nobody's side

Never stay a minute too long

Don't forget the best will go wrong

Nobody's on nobody's side



Better learn to go it alone 

Recognize you're out on your own

Nobody's on nobody's side



The set changes to the Merano Mountain Inn. FLORENCE puts on a coat.



*FLORENCE

OK - now for the Merano Mountain Inn.







Scene Nine : Mountain Duet



A restaurant half-way up a mountain in Merano. It is packed with laughing, noisy, 
celebrating people, many singing the epic song "Der Kleine Franz." ANATOLY is in the 
middle of the crowd. FLORENCE enters and fights her way through to ANATOLY. 
They try to talk but it's impossible. They decide to go outside.



CHORUS (lyrical accuracy not guaranteed!)

Der kleine Franz

Er sagt: ein prosit

Meide den Schmerz!

Ich bin wie ein

Tannenbaum so grun im Herz

Bier ist was ich brauche

Wann in Hofbrauhaus

Trinken Bruderlein,

Und lassen die Sorgen aus

Es gibt gemutlichkeit

Und Freude, saubere zunft

Lorelei un Bratwurst

Gute Nacht Zukunft!

Und jetzt

Im tiefen Keller

Sitz Ich hier

Schon am Morgen

Fing' ich an

Und trinke Bier



Der kleine Franz

Ist auf de Heide

Ich bin im Wald

Lustig bin ich nicht

Mein Sauerkraut ist kalt!

Drunten in dem grunen Thal

Ein Birnbaum steht

Lieben bringt uns

Grosse Freud' und Zeit

Bald vergeht

Er war in Heidelberg gesoffen

Ein braver Mann!

Hier in Munchen

Niemand das Vertragen kann

Zum wohl!

Da streiten sich

Die Leut herum

Bruderlein und Kummer

Sind ja nicht so dumm



Outside, away from the noise:



florence

This is the one situation

I wanted most to avoid

Nothing I say will convince him this isn't a trick 



anatoly

A walk on a clear moonlit night - I relax, she smiles

There's something peculiar going on



florence

So, through my own stupid fault, I'm stuck here to

carry the can

Embarrassed, deserted, marooned



anatoly

Now she can't be working for them - I mean us -

She seems so very straightforward - but where is he?



florence

He has to turn up - it's not just for money - 

perhaps it is!



anatoly

Maybe he's scared - just as scared as he was in the game



florence

Oh I just couldn't care less

He can go right ahead, go and wreck his career,

I know I've done my best



anatoly

Well at least she's a good-looking spy



florence

What if my Russian friend thinks that my plans

Have nothing to do with the chess?

If I don't say something and soon

He'll go - Nobody's on nobody's side!



anatoly (for the first time addressing FLORENCE)

Listen, I hate to break up the mood

Get to the point, begin the beguine

Haven't you noticed we are one character short

In this idyllic, well-produced scene?



florence

He couldn't wait to join you up here

Maybe he walked, cable cars scare him



anatoly

Never mind him - I haven't missed him so far



florence

Maybe it won't do any harm

To struggle on without his charm



anatoly

Funny how all at once I feel that he can go jump off 

the mountain I won't care



florence

This is the one situation I wanted most to avoid



anatoly

My dear opponent - I really can't imagine why



florence

So I am not dangerous then? - what a shame!



anatoly

Oh you're not dangerous - who could think that of you?



florence + anatoly

You - you are so strange - why can't you be

what you ought to be?

You should be scheming, intriguing, too 

clever by half -



anatoly

I have to hand it to you

For you've managed to make me forget why I

ever agreed to this farce



florence + anatoly

I don't know why I can't think of anything

I would rather do

Than be wasting my time on mountains with you



Suddenly they are aware that they have been joined by FREDERICK. 



FREDERICK

Who'd ever think it?

Such a pretty setting!

Tell me what's the betting

Very pretty plotting too?

No matter - I've done all your work for you.



*What do all Soviets deserve? Have you forgotten? Well you'll soon *remember!



Who'd ever guess it?

Daughter in collaboration

With the very nation

Gave her father the third degree!

Where's Daddy? Dead or in the KGB?



(FLORENCE runs off)



*FREDERICK (continued)

I've agreed to new terms, which in short means more money. For you too, but that can't 
be helped. This meeting is therefore unnecessary - the match can continue and we don't 
have to be friends. 



ANATOLY and FREDERICK are left staring at each other. They are already in their 
positions for the continuation of the match.







Scene Ten : Chess 2



The arena and surrounding areas. The match has been resumed. We see it through the 
eyes of the world's media. ANATOLY forges ahead to a 5-2 lead.







Scene Eleven : Florence Quits/Pity the Child



FREDERICK/FLORENCE's suite. FREDERICK is there already, FLORENCE enters.



FREDERICK 

*Five games to two. It's all over - 



So you got what you want

What a nasty ambition!

Set me up, pull me down

Then exploit my condition

I should have guessed, woman

That if pressed, woman

You're on nobody's side but your own

And you're behaving 

Like a mere woman

It's so clear woman -

It's your sex!

Once they start getting old and getting worried

They let fly, take it out

On the one who supports them

That's you I'm talking about



florence

Who'd ever guess it?

Such a squalid little ending

Watching you descending

Just as far as you can go

I'm learning things I didn't want to know



FREDERICK

Who'd ever think it?

This would be the situation -

One more observation -

How'd we ever get this far

Before you showed me what you really are?



florence

You'll be lost without me 

To abuse like you're used to



FREDERICK

Go away! Just get out! Be someone else's parasite!



(But FLORENCE has already gone)

FREDERICK

When I was nine I learned survival

Taught myself not to care

I was my single good companion

Taking my comfort there

Up in my room I planned my conquests

On my own - never asked for a helping hand

No one would understand

I never asked the pair who fought below

Just in case they said no



Pity the child who has ambition

Knows what he wants to do

Knows that he'll never fit the system

Others expect him to

Pity the child who knew his parents

Saw their faults, saw their love die before his eyes

Pity a child that wise

He never asked did I cause your distress?

Just in case they said yes



When I was twelve my father moved out

Left with a whimper - not with a shout

I didn't miss him - he made it perfectly clear

I was a fool and probably queer

Fool that I was I thought this would bring

Those he had left closer together

She made her move the moment he walked away

I was the last the woman told

She never let her bed get cold

Someone moved in - I shut my door

Someone to treat her just the same way as before



I took the road of least resistance

I had my game to play

I had the skill, and more - the hunger

Easy to get away

Pity the child with no such weapons

No defence, no escape from the ties that bind

Always a step behind

I never called to tell her all I'd done

I was only her son!



Pity the child but not forever

Not if he stays that way

He can get all he ever wanted

If he's prepared to pay

Pity instead the careless mother

What she missed 

What she lost when she let me go

And I wonder does she know

I wouldn't call - a crazy thing to do

Just in case she said who?



Back in the Arbiter's chambers the ARBITER opens an envelope before an anxious 
gathering of all those involved in the championship.



arbiter

Frederick Trumper has resigned. Anatoly Sergievsky is the new World Champion.





Sensation. Wild celebrations and back-slapping in the Russian camp. FLORENCE is 
alone and still on her side of the stage. Suddenly, ANATOLY breaks free of his 
colleagues and runs to FLORENCE. They both rush off.



*TV PRESENTER (on screen)

The drama at the World Chess Championship here in Merano, Italy is now off the board. 
Barely had Anatoly Sergievsky of the Soviet Union been proclaimed the new World 
Champion thanks to his crushing of the former champion Freddie Trumper of the United 
States by six games to two, when he upstaged his own triumph by deserting his Soviet 
team and supporters. He is now believed to be seeking political asylum in the West...









Scene Twelve : Embassy Lament/Heaven Help My Heart



An unspecified embassy or, more likely, a consulate, in Merano. WALTER leads 
ANATOLY and FLORENCE into the consulate. CIVIL SERVANTS seem uninterested.





CIVIL SERVANTS (to each other)

Oh my dear how boring

He's defecting

Just like all the others

He's expecting

Us to be impressed with what he's done here

But he

Hasn't stopped to think about the paperwork

His gesture causes

We've an embassy to run here

If these people can't strike blows for freedom

With a valid visa

We don't need 'em

(to ANATOLY)

If we seem offhand then please remember

This is nothing very special 

He's the fourth we've had since last November

(to each other)

Who do these foreign chappies think they are?



And when he's safely in the West 

He'll be the hero to discuss

The media will lionize him

Fame and fortune plus

No one will recall 

It's thanks to us.



*civil servant # 1

You have a wife?



*anatoly

Yes.



*CIVIL SERVANT # 1

You have two children?



*anatoly

Yes.



*CIVIL SERVANT # 2

And they are not coming with you?



(FLORENCE and WALTER both show particular but differing interest in this 
conversation. Maybe WALTER scribbles something on a pad.)



*anatoly

No - not for the moment.



*CIVIL SERVANT # 2

You play chess. You are good at it? Ah yes, it says here you are World Champion.



*anatoly

Since yesterday. 



*CIVIL SERVANT # 1

That's still good.



*walter

Gentlemen, you guys are dealing with a major international figure. May I -



*CIVIL SERVANT # 2

Are you defecting too, sir?



*walter

...no, this man is a citizen of the Soviet Union - I am an American citizen and by the 
authority of this government and this agency (he shows the CIVIL SERVANTS a card) I 
demand that you give this man your immediate attention!



CIVIL SERVANTs

Have you an appointment with the consul?

If you don't we know what his response'll

Be, he will not see you, with respect it

Buggers up his very taxing schedule

Pushing peace and understanding

Let us hope this won't affect it

Far too many jokers cross the border

Not a single document in order

Europe is a bloody free for all now

Extra work for us but you don't care 

Oh how we miss the Berlin wall, now

Who do these foreign chappies think they are?

And when you've filled in all the forms

And been passed clear of all disease

Debriefed debugged dedrugged disarmed

And disinfected, please

Don't forget the guys who cut your keys



As the paperwork staggers on, FLORENCE moves away from the argument:



florence

If it were love I would give that love every 

second I had

And I do

Do I know where he'll lead me to?

Did I plan

Doing all of this for the love of a man?

Well I let it happen anyhow

And what I'm feeling now

Has no easy explanation, reason plays no part

Heaven help my heart

I love him too much

What if he saw my whole existence

Turning around a word, a smile, a touch?



One of these days, and it won't be long, 

he'll know more about me

Than he should

All my dreams will be understood

No surprise

Nothing more to learn from the look in my eyes

Don't you know that time is not my friend?

I'll fight it to the end

Hoping to keep that best of moments

When the passions start

Heaven help my heart

The day that I find

Suddenly I've run out of secrets

Suddenly I'm not always on his mind



Maybe it's best to love a stranger

Well that's what I've done - heaven help my heart

Heaven help my heart



Various documents are stamped and handed to ANATOLY. With great delight he rushes 
over to FLORENCE and they hurry out. WALTER picks up a phone.







Scene Thirteen : Anthem



WALTER, FLORENCE and ANATOLY arrive at Merano station. As they arrive they 
are surrounded by pressmen.



*reporter #1

Excuse me, Mr. Sergievsky. Why are you leaving Russia?



(ANATOLY tries to brush him off)



What about your wife and family?



reporters

How long was this planned?

What made you defect?

Did anyone help you?

And do you expect

To be joined in your exile

By loved ones e.g. your wife?

Or are you starting again

In all aspects of life?



*anatoly

Walter, you bastard! You never told me you'd fixed all this!



*reporter # 2

Why did you leave Russia?



anatoly

*I don't leave anything!



No man, no madness

Though their sad power may prevail

Can possess, conquer, my country's heart

They rise to fail

She is eternal

Long before nations lines were drawn

When no flags flew, when no armies stood

My land was born



And you ask me why I love her

Through wars, death and despair

She is the constant, we who don't care

And you wonder will I leave her - but how?

I cross over borders but I'm still there now



How can I leave her?

Where would I start?

Let man's petty nations tear themselves apart

My land's only borders lie around my heart.



end of act one



ACT TWO



Scene Fourteen : One Night In Bangkok



Bangkok. A year later.



The Act opens with the Golden Ballet leading into "One Night in Bangkok."



The match (ANATOLY v. LEONID VIIGAND, the new Soviet Champion) has already 
started as FREDERICK argues with the locals in the song.



FREDERICK

Bangkok! Oriental setting

And the city don't know what the city is getting

The creme de la creme of the chess world in a

Show with everything but Yul Brynner



Time flies! Doesn't seem a minute

Since the Tirolean spa had the chess boys in it

All change! Don't you know that when you

Play at this level there's no ordinary venue



It's Iceland - or the Philippines - or Hastings - or - or this place!



chorus

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster

The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free

You'll find a god in every golden cloister

And if you're lucky then the god's a she

I can feel an angel sliding up to me



FREDERICK

One town's very like another

When your head's down over your pieces, brother



chorus

It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity

To be looking at the board, not looking at the city



FREDERICK

Whaddya mean? You've seen one crowded, polluted,

stinking town, you've -



chorus

Tea, girls, warm, sweet

Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham Suite



FREDERICK

Get Thai'd! You're taking to a tourist

Whose every move's among the purest

I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine



chorus

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble

Not much between despair and ecstasy

One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble

Can't be too careful with your company

I can feel the devil walking next to me



FREDERICK

Siam's gonna be the witness

To the ultimate test in cerebral fitness

This grips me more than would a

Muddy old river or reclining Buddha



I don't see you guys rating

The kind of mate I'm contemplating

I'd let you watch, I would invite you

But the queens we use would not excite you



So you'd better go back to your bars, your temples, your massage parlors



chorus

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster

The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free

You'll find a god in every golden cloister

A little flesh, a little history

I can feel an angel sliding up to me



One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble

Not much between despair and ecstasy

One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble

Can't be too careful with your company

I can feel the devil walking next to me









Scene Fifteen : Florence and Anatoly/You and I



The Oriental Hotel, Bangkok. ANATOLY and FLORENCE in their suite. They are 
watching FREDERICK on television.



*frederick

This is Frederick Trumper on behalf of International Global Television. The all-Russian 
struggle for world chess supremacy is well under way here in steamy Bangkok, Thailand. 
But it's also a titanic battle between East and West, with the current World Champion a 
stateless person., having defected to the free world when he won his title last year in icy 
Merano, Italy.



Anatoly clicks channels, gets Abba singing "Money Money Money." Clicks back to 
FREDERICK:



It's honours even so far with the match only two games old. In the first game Sergievsky 
was inspired and Viigand played like a man petrified, awestruck -



anatoly (switching TV off)

But why is he really here?

A whole year of silence

Then suddenly here he is -



*florence

He's working for the TV company, for a lot of money



anatoly

So that's all it is then? 

He has no desire to see you anymore?



florence

Who cares what he's up to?

You're not playing him



anatoly

Oh no? I've the feeling I am

*Why is he here?



florence

Don't talk yourself out of form

Viigand's the one

You have to beat



anatoly

And he's a fine player



Florence

Predictable - he's a machine!



*anatoly

A very fine machine!



florence (light-heartedly, affectionately)

So are you - so are we!

But there is one other thing



*anatoly

What?



florence

I gather Svetlana is hoping to come out here



*anatoly

My wife? In Bangkok? No!



florence

*You must know about it

It's been in the paper

They may let her out -



anatoly

This has to be Molokov - right up his street!



florence

So now you've got one more opponent to beat

Surely you knew - 



anatoly (angry)

I did not!



(pause)



florence

Well this is a problem we knew we'd be facing soon



*anatoly

But not now. But not now



florence

This is an all too familiar scene



anatoly

Life imperceptibly coming between



both

Those whose love is as strong as it could or should be



anatoly

Nothing has altered -



florence

- yet everything's changed



anatoly

No one stands still -



both

Still I love you completely and hope I always will

Each day we get through means one less mistake left for the making



anatoly

And there's no return

As we slowly learn

Of the chance we're taking



florence

I'd give the world to stay just as we are

It's better by far

Not to be too wise



both

Not to realise

Where there's truth there will be lies



florence

You and I

We've seen it all

Been down this road before

Yet we go on believing -



both

You and I

We've seen it all

Chasing our hearts desire

Yet I'm even more certain

This time it will be

My happy ending.



The phone rings. ANATOLY answers:



*anatoly

(Into the phone) Thank you. (He hangs up) The car to take me to the television studio is 
here. You know, the interview I promised Walter -



*florence

Fine - ask Walter what he knows. Maybe they've fixed the result of the match already. 
We could go home now if you're going to lose.



ANATOLY leaves.









Scene Sixteen : The Soviet Machine



MOLOKOV and his cronies have assembled at their HQ in their Bangkok hotel. 
Throughout this scene, only VIIGAND, ANATOLY's challenger, seems interested in 
chess, poring over a board, making moves for both black and white, ignoring most of the 
discussion around him. They have been bugging ANATOLY and FLORENCE's room. 
We hear their last speeches from the previous scene again.



molokov

*Comrades! Why are you looking so worried? We're not dealing with the traitor 
*Sergievsky now. Comrade Viigand here is a disciplined Soviet chess-playing *machine!



Just in case you feel a trace

Of doubt or even nervous tension

Let me draw the latest score 

To your attention



Not the score the witless corps

Of commentators are debating

Come, admit - who gives a shit

For Elo rating?



No, I prefer and I'm sure you concur

To see who's ahead 

Psychologically

For example:



We have on tap an inscrutable chap

Whose thoughts never stray

From the state of the play



(He bangs a gong in VIIGAND's ear. No response.)



*Fantastic!

Whereas - 

It's so difficult to concentrate if

You have left your native 

Country for a woman who has plans of her own

It's not easy for a chap to excel

Feeling guilty as hell

Having left his wife to face the music alone



But even worse, imagine if his ladies met

Well then I bet

The atmosphere round here would be a little strained

As he explained

How he could do what he's done to those two

Most wonderful girls

"Yes I love you both!"



cronies

Most amusing!



molokov

Starting from scratch they'll torpedo his match

His horse-power dead

On the board and in bed



MOLOKOV + CRONIES

Bit by bit the pieces fit

The Soviet Machine advances

Not one move that won't improve 

Our nation's chances



We predict a stunning victory

Both on the board and off it

We will show the traitor no-one

Rats with profit



Oh we're gonna smash that bastard

Make him wanna change his name

Take him to the cleaners and devastate him

Wipe him out, humiliate him

We don't want the whole world saying

They can't even win a game

We have never reckoned on coming second

There's no use in losing



We can feel the flame of triumph burning

Our people's pride returning/Bit by bit the pieces fit

The Soviet machine advances

Not one move that won't improve

Our nation's chances



No I prefer and I'm sure you concur

To see who's ahead

Psychologically

For example:

We have on tap an inscrutable chap

Whose thoughts never stray

From the state of the play



La la la....



Bit by bit the pieces fit

The Soviet Machine advances

Not one move that won't improve 

Our nation's chances



Hey! Hey!



We predict a stunning victory

Both on the board and off it

We will show the traitor no-one

Rats with profit



La la la....La!



From Moscow to the Baring Straits

Citizens will hail our victory

In Arctic circles frozen states

Will join with warmer climes in revelry

And I can say of this affair

I was there, did my share, played my part



And Russians all will be aware

I was there, from the start

Mmm - mmm



VIIGAND

Checkmate! Goodnight.



They are all asleep or drunk, or both, save MOLOKOV and a WAITER. MOLOKOV 
goes to the telephone and makes a call.



*MOLOKOV (into the phone)

Mr. de Courcey? ... Good news. We are going to be able to help each other...yes, heart-
warming international co-operation. I have the proof that Florence Vassy's father is alive 
... you are going to be able to stage a great human rights victory and all we want is a tiny 
triumph on the chess board ... it's on its way to you now ... what's that? ... thank you - 
Walter ... goodbye.



(he hands the WAITER an envelope. The WAITER takes this to WALTER as we merge 
into the next scene - a TV studio)





Scene Seventeen : Interview 



The TV studio. WALTER reads the letter. He registers astonishment. FREDERICK 
arrives.



walter

Remember last night I was saying 

The interview shouldn't be vicious?



(FREDERICK looks surprised)



Well, times have moved on and

Forget what I told you

You have my permission, no - order

To go for the jugular - just as you wanted



*FREDERICK

Well that's fine by me but why the change?



walter

It seems to me on reflection

We don't need to pander to Russians

He may have defected

He may be a good guy

But face it, he's yesterday's issue

*Here are some questions - go for him!



WALTER hands FREDERICK a sheet of questions. FREDERICK exits to get ready for 
the programme.



walter (to FLOOR MANAGER)

Whatever, and I mean whatever,

They say or do make sure you stay on the Russian

Don't let your cameras off him for a moment

*And get the Svetlana video lined up!



Is this the tide in my affairs

When I write a little history?

Or just an interview whose wares

Will flood the screens with triviality?



ANATOLY arrives. WALTER greets him with exaggerated warmth.



Ah, Anatoly! - if I may -

Let me say right away

You'll be thrilled

Because the other seat is filled

*By a long standing friend of yours



FREDERICK returns. ANATOLY is amazed and angry when he sees who is to interview 
him. WALTER steers them both onto the same studio sofa before ANATOLY has time 
to protest. The cameras spring to life - they are on the air.



*TV PRESENTER

Tonight's final item is a fascinating confrontation in connection with the World Chess 
Championship. The former World Champion talks to the man who took his title a year 
ago in Merano, Italy, and who is defending that title right now here in Bangkok.



FREDERICK

Well here we are face to face once again



ANATOLY

By any standards a bizarre reunion



FREDERICK

Is being homeless affecting your game



ANATOLY

I wouldn't know as I've a home in England



FREDERICK

No by a home I mean real home - the place where your family is



ANATOLY

England is my real home!



FREDERICK

What are your latest political aims?



ANATOLY

What are you saying?



FREDERICK

Your anti-Russian crusade - has it worked?



ANATOLY

I'm no crusader - 



FREDERICK

What is your true motivation? - that's something we all want to know



*ANATOLY

Listen - you know damn well what my motivation is -



FREDERICK (to camera)

Here we see a man under great pressure

Two fights to fight yet he could not look fresher

Chess and politics! I take my hat off

To any champion who can pull that off

(to Anatoly)

I hear your second controls everything



anatoly

Chess is her passion



frederick

But her obsession is East versus West



anatoly

Chess is her passion



frederick

I know a little about her and she's got her own axe to grind



*anatoly

That's not true -



frederick

Aren't you concerned that your wife's not here?



anatoly

I don't discuss my private life in public -



frederick

But don't you care that she's not by your side?



anatoly

I think I've had enough of this discussion -



frederick

Well, we've a little surprise, we have 

your wife on the video - 

Let her talk to you, give you her version

How married life has changed since your desertion

Hey! Come back my friend, we're only showing

Home movies, nothing more - where are you going?



A video clip of SVETLANA starts rolling. She is appealing to her husband in Russian. 
ANATOLY pulls off his clip-on microphone (with difficulty) and attempts to leave the 
set.



*walter (to ANATOLY)

A wonderful interview!



ANATOLY barges WALTER aside and exits. The clip changes to the arrival of 
SVETLANA at Bangkok airport.









Scene Eighteen : The Deal



The foyer of the Oriental hotel which becomes a chessboard.



arbiter

Isn't it strange the complications

People attach to situations

Almost as if they want to miss

The wood for the trees

Nothing will change my basic feeling

When they've done all their wheeler-dealing

Those in the strongest situations

Do as they please



*You might see all kinds of human emotion here - passion and pain, love and hate-



I see nothing other than a simple board game



*In the Dusit Thani hotel, Bangkok, Alexander Molokov makes his first move.



molokov

*We did not bring you to Bangkok for a holiday, my dear. You must tell your *husband 
that he has to come home.



You can have the life you want

And anywhere you want it - 



*But if he's going to win, then life is going to be very tough for you - tell *Anatoly that!



Make him think of you not

Narcissistic dreams of glory



*How many times does he want to be champion, anyway?



arbiter

Two days later the wife makes her move...



svetlana

*How many times do you want to be champion anyway?



Who needs a dream? Who needs ambition?

Who'd be the fool in my position?



anatoly

Once I had dreams; now they're obsessions

Hopes became needs, lovers possessions



svetlana

Now you're where you want to be and who you want to be

and doing what you always said you would

and yet you know you haven't won at all

Running for your life and never looking back

in case there's someone right behind to

shoot you down and say he always knew you'd fall



When the crazy wheel slows down

Where will you be? Back where you started



*ARBITER

Back at the Oriental, Walter de Courcey makes his gambit perfectly clear.



*walter

Your father is alive.



*florence

My father? Alive? 



*walter

In Russia. Thirty years in prison. 



*florence

And you think I believe you?



walter

*The evidence is conclusive. And Anatoly will believe me. Now you get Anatoly *to 
lose to Viigand and Molokov assures me he can get your father out - and not *only him - 



There are some people to recover

I know that you would simply love a

Chance to make sure your father's name 

Is high on our list

We want him back which is to say a

Gesture is needed from your player

We wouldn't mind if he got beaten

In fact we insist



florence

There must be a lie

You wouldn't tell me

A limit to your devious ambition

But what they could be

I can't imagine

Is there no one here who's not a politician?

There's no deal! 



(she hands the document back to WALTER who sidles away)



When I was young I learned survival

Taught myself not to care

Luxuries such as father, mother

Vanished into thin air

How can a half-remembered figure

From a past so remote that it's hardly real

Alter the way I feel?

Pity the child who 35 years on

Finds that confidence gone



*arbiter

While in subterranean marble surroundings two of the most powerful players make a mid-
game assessment....



walter

You should have seen how she reacted

I couldn't leave till she'd extracted 

Promises she would see her father

Simple I said

Told her the way she could achieve this

Even though you might not believe this

She said that I was not to worry

Go right ahead



MOLOKOV

You don't know her well

She could have fooled you

She could despite herself try to resist us



walter

I don't think I'm wrong

But let's be certain

There are others we can call in to assist us...



(WALTER moves over to FREDERICK)



*ARBITER

And who better than the dethroned king?



*WALTER

Remember, Freddie, who's paying for you to be here in Bangkok - not the Chess 
Federation. Now we've got a deal to get some people out - including Florence's father - 
provided Anatoly loses, so convince him!



FREDERICK 

(on phone to ANATOLY)

Communist, Democrat



ANATOLY

An intriguing collusion



FREDERICK

Fair exchange - tit for tat



ANATOLY

Comradeship in profusion



FREDERICK

And the appeal, partner

Of this deal, partner

Is we all stand to win

You and me, the lady also

Don't break her heart, partner

FREDERICK (continued)

(+ WALTER + MOLOKOV: Partner!)

Just be smart, partner

(+ WALTER + MOLOKOV: Partner!)

Throw the match, show your love

Is as pure as snow in Moscow



*ANATOLY

Who put you up to this? There's no deal!



*ARBITER

So Frederick makes a desperate final play for the woman he hasn't seen for a year



FREDERICK

Silly boy, woman who

I should not have let walk out

There's no hitch

That we two 

Can't untangle or talk out

And the appeal, partner

Of this deal, partner

Is we both stand to win

We'll bring back the golden era

Stick with me, honey

Leave him be, honey

You don't know what they've planned

For you long ago in Moscow



FLORENCE

Can't you see we've moved on?

Chess has nothing to do with this - 

*Freddie - Chess isn't life!



*FREDERICK

But I've changed - I've grown up! He won't help you! He won't throw the match! I'm 
telling you the truth, Florence!



FLORENCE + FREDERICK

Who'd ever guess it?

This would be the situation

One more complication

Should be neither here nor there

I wish I had it in me not to care



ANATOLY

Let him spill out his hate

Till he knows he's deserted

There's no point wasting time

Preaching to the perverted



FLORENCE + ANATOLY + FREDERICK + SVETLANA

Who'd ever think it?

No-one makes the moves intended

'Til the game has ended

Then they say I told you so

I'm learning things I didn't want to know



*FREDERICK

It can all be different now Florence - I love you!



ARBITER

Everybody's playing the game

But nobody's rules are the same



ALL

Nobody's on nobody's side

Everybody's playing the game

But nobody's rules are the same

Nobody's on nobody's side









Scene Nineteen : I Know Him So Well



After the deal, FLORENCE and SVETLANA are the only two to remain.



*florence

Svetlana?



*SVETLANA

Florence



*FLORENCE

I don't know what to say



*SVETLANA

There is nothing. I have seen what he really needs and I can't give that to him - you can



FLORENCE

*You don't understand. What he really needs is you and his family -



Nothing is so good it lasts eternally

Perfect situations must go wrong

But this has never yet prevented me

Wanting far too much for far too long

Looking back I could have played it differently

Won a few more moments, who can tell?

But it took time to understand the man

Now at least I know I know him well

FLORENCE (continued)

Wasn't it good?



SVETLANA

Oh so good



florence

Wasn't he fine?



SVETLANA

Oh so fine



florence

Isn't it madness?



both

He can't be mine?



florence

But in the end he needs a little bit more than me

More security



SVETLANA

He needs his fantasy and freedom



florence

I know him so well



SVETLANA

No one in your life is with you constantly

No one is completely on your side

And though I move my world to be with him

Still the gap between us is too wide

Looking back I could have played it differently



florence

Looking back I could have played it differently



SVETLANA

Learned about the man before I fell



florence

I was just a little careless maybe



SVETLANA

But I was ever so much younger then



florence

Now at least I know him well



SVETLANA

Now at least



both

I know I know him well



SVETLANA

Wasn't it good?



florence

Oh so good



SVETLANA

Wasn't he fine?



florence

Oh so fine



SVETLANA

Isn't it madness



both

He won't be mine?

Didn't I know How it would go?

If I knew from the start

Why am I falling apart?



SVETLANA

Wasn't it good?

Wasn't he fine



florence

Isn't it madness



both

He won't be mine?



florence

Isn't it madness



both

He won't be mine?



florence

But in the end he needs a little bit more than me -

More security



SVETLANA

He needs his fantasy and freedom



florence

I know him so well



SVETLANA

It took time to understand him



both

I know him so well.









Scene Twenty: The Temple 



A Buddhist temple. MONKS chanting. ANATOLY enters.



*ANATOLY

(reading note) 

Meet me in the temple of the Reclining Buddha? Meet who?



(FREDERICK enters)



Oh it's you!



FREDERICK

This is the one situation

I wanted most to avoid - 



ANATOLY

Then what on earth are we doing?

I could be better employed - 



FREDERICK

No - please hear me out

I think I can help -



ANATOLY

If it's about Florence

I'm warning you - 



FREDERICK

No - it's not about her, your wife or your kids

Or money or Walter, or Molokov



ANATOLY

What the hell is it?



FREDERICK

I want to talk chess!



*ANATOLY

Chess?



FREDERICK

Something I've noticed in Viigand

It's his King's Indian defence -

One of the lines he's been trying

Doesn't completely make sense - 



ANATOLY

I - I don't understand -



FREDERICK

I told you - his King's -



ANATOLY

No - I don't understand why 

You're helping me



FREDERICK

Because I love chess!

Does nobody else?

Jesus - sometimes I think I'm the only one

How can you let mediocrity win?



anatoly

I think I believe you. Show me



(FREDERICK begins to explain with a pocket chess set)



*FREDERICK

You know, in all my dealings with Florence I never once made a good move



*anatoly

Me too, Freddie, if I win, it's bad for her father and I can't lose for the wrong reasons - 



FREDERICK

How can you let mediocrity win?



(FREDERICK leaves)









Scene Twenty-One : Endgame



The Arena. The final game in the final match between ANATOLY and VIIGAND.



choir

Morphy, Anderssen, Steinitz, Lasker, Capablanca,

Alekhine, Euwe, Botvinnik, Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian,

Spassky, Fischer, Karpov, Kasparov



(NB: this is the chronological order of champions. On the album the names are not sung 
in this order; neither was current champ Kasparov included)



*arbiter

Two weeks ago I gave you a limit of six more games to end this sequence of draws. Five 
of these have now passed. If today's game does not produce a decision, the match is 
cancelled.



*FREDERICK (on TV screen)

All eyes in the world of chess and indeed many eyes outside it are turned towards 
Bangkok, Thailand, today where the final match in this gripping encounter has just been 
launched with ceremonial splendor. And all the talk is of the recent and sensational loss 
of form of the World Champion who seems certain to surrender his title here today.



molokov

How straightforward the game

When one has trust in one's player

And how great the relief

Working for one who believes in

Loyalty, heritage, true to his kind come what may



walter (to Molokov)

Though it gives me no joy

Adding to your satisfaction

You can safely assume

Your late unlamented employee

Knows if he wins then the only thing won is the chess



molokov

It's the weak who accept

Tawdry untruths about freedom

Prostituting themselves

Chasing a spurious starlight

Trinkets in airports sufficient to lead them astray



FLORENCE

Does the player exist

In any human endeavor

Who's been known to resist

Sirens of fame and possessions?

Nothing can harm the successful except for success



By now the CHOIR has stopped singing names of champions and are instead reprising 
FREDERICK's lines from Act One:



1956 - Budapest is rising

1956 - Budapest is fighting

1956 - Budapest is falling

1956 - Budapest is dying



anatoly

They all think they see a man

Who doesn't know

Which move to make

Which way to go

Whose private life

Caused his decline

Wrecked his grand design

Some are vicious, some are fools

And others blind

To see in me

One of their kind



Anyone can be

A husband, lover

Sooner them than me

When they discover

Their domestic bliss is

Shelter for their failing



Nothing could be worse

Than self-denial

Having to rehearse

The endless trial

Of a partner's rather sad

Demands prevailing



svetlana

As you watch yourself caring

About a minor sporting triumph, sharing

Your win with esoterics,

Paranoids, hysterics

Who don't pay attention to

What goes on around them

They leave the ones they love the way they found them

A normal person must

Dismiss you with disgust

And weep for those who trusted you



anatoly

Nothing you have said

Is revelation

Take my blues as read

My consolation - 

Finding out at last my one true obligation!



FLORENCE

Since you seem to have shut out

The world at large then maybe I should cut out

My tiny inessential

World, inconsequential

In the kind of games you're playing

How do you do it?

I tried to be that cynical but blew it

I only changed your life

You left your home, your wife

Or maybe that had slipped your mind



anatoly

Nothing you have said

Is revelation

Take my blues as read

My consolation - 

Finding out at last my one true obligation!



svetlana/florence/crowd

Listen to them shout!

They saw you do it

In their minds no doubt

That you've been through it

Suffered for your art but

In the end a winner



We have never heard

Such an ovation

Who could not be stirred?

Such dedication

Skill and guts a model

For the young beginner



They're completely enchanted

But they don't take your qualities for granted

It isn't very often

That the critics soften

Nonetheless you've won their hearts

How can we begin to

Appreciate the work that you've put into

Your calling through the years

The blood and sweat and tears

The late, late nights, the early starts



There they go again!

Your deeds inflame them

Drive them wild, but then

Who wants to tame them?

If they want a part of you

Who'd really blame them?



anatoly

And so you're letting me know -



florence

And you're the only one who's never suffered anything at all



anatoly

How you've hated my success - 



SVETlana

Well I won't crawl -

And you can slink back to your pawns and to your tarts



anatoly

And every poisoned word shows that you never understood



SVETlana

Liar!



anatoly

Never!



SVETlana

Liar!



anatoly

Never!



florence

Liar!



anatoly

Never!



SVETlana + FLORENCE

Liar!



anatoly

Never! Never!



ANATOLY, FLORENCE, SVETLANA

Nothing you have said

Is revelation

Takes my blues as read

My consolation - 



SVETlana + florence

Finding out that I'm my only obligation



anatoly

Is there no-one in my life

Who will not claim

The right to steal

My work, my name

My success, my fame

And my freedom?



As ANATOLY concludes his words, he sets off on a series of sensational moves that 
culminate in the checkmate of VIIGAND. Pandemonium.



*arbiter

Anatoly Sergievsky is the winner.









Scene Twenty-Two : You and I/Florence and Walter/Epilogue



The arena after all the crowds have gone.



*florence

So - you've done it. You're still the champion. 



*anatoly

I had to win. If I had lost for Molokov, I would be the same as Molokov. I had to win to 
be free.



*florence

Free? For what?



*anatoly

Free to decide what we are going to do.



*florence

No Anatoly. You aren't free - neither am I. You have to go back - your wife and your 
family -



*anatoly

Your father -



florence

This is an all too familiar scene



anatoly

Life imperceptibly coming between



both

Those whose love is as strong as it could or should be



florence

I'd give the world to stay just as we are

It's better by far



both

Not to be too wise

As we realize

There was truth and there were lies



The arena dissolves into the airport.



anatoly

Knowing I want you

Knowing I love you

I can't explain

Why I remain

Careless about you



florence

I've been a fool to allow

Dreams to become great expectations



anatoly

How can I love you so much yet make no move?



both

I pray the days and nights

In their endless weary procession

Soon overwhelm my sad obsession



You and I

We've seen it all

Chasing our hearts' desire

But we go on pretending

Stories like ours

Have happy endings



anatoly

You could not give me

More than you gave me

Why should there be something in me

Still discontented?



florence

I won't look back anymore

And if I do - just for a moment



anatoly

I'll soon be happy to say I knew you when



both

But if you hear today

I'm no longer quite so devoted

To this affair, I've been misquoted



You and I

We've seen it all

Chasing our hearts' desire

But we go on pretending

Stories like ours

Have happy endings



They hold each other for the final time, then separate. MOLOKOV, SVETLANA and 
Russian DELEGATES arrive. Eventually ANATOLY joins them and leaves with them to 
board a plane. Soon after they are gone, WALTER arrives at the airport.



*walter

So in the end our hero won

Brilliantly!

Surprised us all -

He played as well as he has ever done



*florence

No surprise - and what's more he's gone back to the Soviet Union.



walter

He seems unable to win

Without the added thrill of changing sides



(pause - no response from FLORENCE)



Is there nothing more you have to say?



florence

No, you wouldn't listen anyhow

And what I'm feeling now

Has no easy explanation

Hasn't this been a great achievement?

Losing your man and nothing in return!



walter



*Not my man - your man. Anyway, Anatoly's return to the Soviet bosom is a very decent 
gesture if I may say so - he has virtually guaranteed us - er, you - your father. He must 
have done it for you, he wouldn't have done it for me.



(sings)



Don't be so quick to put us down

We'll get your father out soon

That is, as long as he is still alive



*florence

What - what did you say?



*walter (backing away)

Well, we can't be sure that he's alive but you couldn't be sure that he was dead, so you're 
no worse off....



(WALTER sidles out)



florence

*Playing games - using our lives for nothing! 



(The COMPANY enters)



How to survive them?

Where do I start?

Let man's petty nations tear themselves apart

My land's only borders lie around my heart




The End
